                                <b>Brief Description</b><br>
                                <p>This project aimed to develop a robust methodology to identify high injury networks within a given study area. 
                                High injury networks refer to specific roadway locations classified as particularly dangerous for road users, including drivers, 
                                pedestrians, and cyclists. The toolkit provides local governments and transportation agencies with a data-driven approach 
                                to focus on these high-risk areas, enabling targeted interventions and funding requests to mitigate traffic deaths.</p>

                                <p>This project was developed for the transportation planning sector, specifically focusing on road safety and injury mitigation 
                                aligned with Vision Zero initiatives. The primary clients are local governments, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), 
                                and other safety-conscious transportation planners.</p>

                                <b>Key Business Line</b><br>
                                <p>The High Injury Network Toolkit opens significant opportunities for expansion within WSP's transportation safety business line. 
                                By automating a complex analysis that relies on data commonly available to most clients, we have developed a scalable, repeatable solution that delivers actionable safety insights.</p>
                                <p>The automated methodology for identifying high injury networks can be rapidly deployed, offering clients precise and statistically backed 
                                injury and fatality metrics to inform roadway safety. Alongside automated reporting and interactive data visualization, this toolkit is ready to be marketed as a productized solution.</p>

                            <p>
                                <b>Growth Potential</b><br>
                                <p>This toolkit has immense potential for growth. It is adaptable to any size or level of study area, from small cities to multi-county regions. The simplicity of its inputs — 
                                requiring only crash data, road network geometry, and a few additional variables — means that most agencies concerned with transportation safety will be able to utilize it.</p>
                                <p>Moreover, the statistical precision of the toolkit’s output surpasses competing methodologies, which rely on less flexible approaches. This presents a unique opportunity for WSP 
                                to position itself as a leader in transportation safety analytics, with a strong emphasis on precision, automation, and efficiency.</p>

                                <b>Key Features</b><br>

                                <p>The toolkit's core strength lies in its automation and precision. It requires only three inputs and can process large areas, such as the five-county Puget Sound region, 
                                in just a few hours. This speed is combined with an innovative methodology that significantly improves upon industry standards.</p>
                                <p>Key features include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Automated Roadway Segmentation</b>: Unlike competing methods, which rely on existing road network geometries, we discretize every network link into 10-meter segments. 
                                        This approach eliminates biases caused by irregular link lengths and allows for more precise crash density calculations.</li>
                                    <li><b>Sliding Window Approach</b>: To smooth crash density estimates, the toolkit applies multiple sliding windows to the crash data and averages the results. 
                                        This technique provides a robust, intuitive, and visually continuous representation of high-risk locations.</li>
                                    <li><b>Comprehensive Reporting</b>: The toolkit includes automated visualizations and maps that allow clients to easily interpret the results. 
                                        Interactive tools also allow for further exploration and validation of the analysis.</li>
                                </ul> 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <b>Scalability & Flexibility</b><br>
                                <p>The toolkit can be deployed at any geographic scale and tailored to various road user types, such as cars, bicycles, or pedestrians. Its flexibility makes it 
                                suitable for a wide range of projects, from local safety initiatives to state-wide transportation planning.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, while the current version focuses on identifying high injury networks, the underlying methodology can be adapted to other applications, such as 
                                analyzing driveway densities or other point-based phenomena along road networks.</p>
                            </p>

                                <p>The High Injury Network Toolkit was delivered with the following major outcomes:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Comprehensive High Injury Network Analysis </b>for the Puget Sound region, identifying dangerous locations for cars, pedestrians, and cyclists.</li>
                                    <li><b>Automated Reporting Suite</b> providing maps and visualizations to facilitate client decision-making. The HIN dashboard allows the client to 
                                        adjust parameters (serious injuries and fatalities per mile, minimum safety corridor lengths, etc.) after the data has been processed.</li>

                                <p>The toolkit directly benefited the Puget Sound Regional Council (PSCR) by providing a precise, automated solution for identifying both high-injury corridors, 
                                roadway segments that are dangerous for all road users, and high-risk corridors, or corridors that show a high concentration of severe crash outcomes for 
                                bicyclists and pedestrians. This data has the potential to secure funding for traffic safety improvements and prioritization of SS4A and complete streets 
                                projects, allowing the client to target interventions more effectively.</p>
                                <p>
                                The toolkit's user-friendly outputs — including maps and interactive dashboards — allow non-technical stakeholders to engage with the data and make informed 
                                decisions, significantly enhancing its value.

                                <b>Expansion Opportunities</b><br>
                                <p>The High Injury Network Toolkit is not only adaptable to various geographic scales but also offers opportunities for future expansion into different transportation modes and 
                                   time-based analyses. For example, high injury networks could be analyzed across different periods to track changes in road safety over time or in response to infrastructure changes.</p>
                                <p>Another potential avenue is adapting the methodology to analyze other point-based phenomena, such as the distribution of driveways, to provide additional insights to transportation planners.</p>

                                <b>Next Steps</b><br>
                                <p>Future development could involve incorporating predictive modeling to assess the relationship between high injury networks and built environment features. This would 
                                    enable clients to proactively address risk factors and implement safety improvements before crashes occur.</p>
